# Self-Driven-car
self driven car using artificial intelligence and deep learning

# Description
A AI based model to train a model to reach its destination from source by taking shortest possible route and having its own senses to detect obstacle in between its path. This model also has capability to handle obstacle and find new fastest possible path.

# Concept
Car is having brain here.It can memorises the shortest possible path and this is done using artificial intelligence along with deep learning .Car can also use memorised data to future references.


# Files used
## 1.map.py
Map file used to build an application framework on which we can see our project working.

## 2.ai.py
AI file is for giving our model brain to think and to store the previously learnt data. 


# Api needed
kivy packages
pytorch
numpy
matplot

# Conclusion 
Here we have a AI app having its own brain and learning to tackle with obstacle in path and we also have performance chart for our car which shows its performance according to its accuracy .We are also able to save car learnt data and reload when require in future.
